Quade test for non parametric two way ANalysis Of VAriance.<br/>
This function performs the Quade test to analyze unreplicated complete block
designs.
Dana Quade in 1979 proposed a test that is often more powerful than the
Friedman test. It also eliminates block differences but weights the raw data
indicate possibly more marked treatment effects. Whereas the Friedman test is
basically an extension of the sign test, the Quade test is effectively an
extension of the Wilcoxon signed rank test and is equivalent to it when the
treatments are two.
